auto-win-vm-ad
==============

Automatically create Windows Virtual Machines with Active Directory
and Certificate Services

This allows you to create a Windows VM complete with Active Directory and
Certificate Services, and Active Directory TLS/SSL enabled, completely
automated and unattended.

Currently only tested on (and hardcoded to work with) RHEL 6.3 with kvm/qemu
virtualization and Windows Server 2008 R2 Enterprise Datacenter 64-bit.
